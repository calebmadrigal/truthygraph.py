# truthygraph.py

Truthygraph is a self-contained math equation graphing script, which graphs not only where an equation is true, but also where it is nearly true (the error gradient of the function).

Truthygraph is intended as a starting point for doing art using math and code. The recommended way to use it is to copy the `truthy_graph.py` script to a new file name, and modify it. Truthygraph is the fundamental starting point that Caleb Madrigal uses for doing art at <https://gods.art>.

## Usage

    pip install pillow
    cp truthy_graph.py my_equation.py
    # Modify the equation() function to some equation you want to graph
    python my_equation.py

## License

You are free to copy `truthy_graph.py` as a starting point for doing your own art, or graphing equations, or whatever else you want. If you do use truthygraph, giving credit is appreciated, but not required.
